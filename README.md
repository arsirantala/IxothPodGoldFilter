# IxothPodGoldFilter
POD filter which focuses showing valuable items (while not forgetting any uniques, set, RW items)

# General
The filter hides normal elite items which are worth less than 35k gold - exception to the rule are normal elite items which have more than 1 sockets (useful RW items).

This filter uses Pure Karma filter's code related to:
* Inventory
* Potions
* Gems
* Runes
* Small portion about the 35k gold items

Thanks goes to KarmaNation on the parts of his filter code, regarding to the above parts.
