# IxothPodGoldFilter
POD filter which focuses showing valuable items (while not forgetting any uniques, set, RW items).

# General
The filter hides normal elite items which are worth less than 35k gold (exception to the rule are normal elite items which have more than 1 sockets (useful RW items)).

This filter does not show unid unique/set items with their right name - this filter aims to be as simple as possible, focusing on the gold farming (by user then selling the valuables to npcs). Gold which is useful in gambling :)

This filter uses Pure Karma filter's code related to:
* Inventory
* Potions
* Gems
* Runes
* Small portion about the 35k gold items

Thanks goes to KarmaNation on the parts of his filter code, regarding to the above parts.

# What items are hidden?
* Magic rings and amulets are not shown if their item level is not at least 88
* Magic bolts and arrows
* Normal elite items which are worth less than 35k gold (exception to the rule are normal elite items which have more than 1 sockets (useful RW items))
* Certain inventory related items which Pure Karma filter also hides (id/tp scrolls, keys, low level health, mana, antidote, thawing, stamina, choking gas, exploding, fulminating, oil, rancid gas and strangling gas potions). Also certain gems are hidden (based on character level)
